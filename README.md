# big_lc_mod_profile
just a place to track changes to the mod profile

full change history (starting recently) is [here](https://github.com/hoffr/big_lc_mod_profile/commits/main/)
- a 'commit' is just a set of changes to the files. here we just track the mods' config files themselves and mod names/versions
- to see what mods have been added/updated/removed, on that page just click the topmost commits until you see one that shows 'plugins_version_list.txt' on the resulting left sidebar

latest mod manager profile code will always be [here](https://github.com/hoffr/big_lc_mod_profile/blob/main/profile_code.txt)

note: this repo doesn't track which mods are enabled/disabled, only ones which are installed. will prob change that soon
