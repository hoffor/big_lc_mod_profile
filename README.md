# big_lc_mod_profile
just a place to track changes to the mod profile

latest changes are [here](https://github.com/hoffr/big_lc_mod_profile/commit/9e107c8d4b6fdef1d7599adf6ead10fc44a29d37#diff-7de4dfbdcc05819bdadf664acfab7fd6abdbe5064cbff499ab7969f2d5a671cb)

full change history (starting recently) is [here](https://github.com/hoffr/big_lc_mod_profile/commits/main/)

latest mod manager profile code is [here](https://github.com/hoffr/big_lc_mod_profile/blob/main/profile_code.txt)

small issue with this is that it doesn't track which mods are enabled/disabled, only ones which are installed
