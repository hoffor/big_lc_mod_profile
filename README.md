# big_lc_mod_profile
just a place to track changes to the mod profile i maintain for me n friends. feel free to enjoy this mod list no matter who you are! it's designed to be a thoughtful and balanced experience, as long as your PC has the RAM for it lol

simple changelogs and the latest profile code are all [here](https://github.com/hoffor/big_lc_mod_profile/releases)

full technical change history (starting recently) is [here](https://github.com/hoffr/big_lc_mod_profile/commits/main/). this often shows a LOT of changes per commit, but most of it are config file changes auto-generated by the game
- a 'commit' is just a set of published changes to the files in a repo. in this specific repo we track the mods' config files themselves and the mod names/versions, but we don't actually back up the other mod files
- to see what mods have been added/updated/removed, on that page just click the topmost commits until you see one that shows 'plugins_version_list.txt' on the resulting left sidebar (if that commit has a sidebar)
